# Mint-Sign-Up-Page

This is a replica of the popular financial management service called Mint. The core idea here was to make a mere replica of their very simplistic Sign Up page.

# Usage

You can view the page by opening the index.html file.

# Written in HTML and CSS

All styling code was separated from the index.html file and have been placed in styles.css for better code readability.

The project also exercises semantics to make the code more readable.
